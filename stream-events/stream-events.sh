# Request the identifier for a market
url="$NODE_URL_REST/markets"
response="$(curl -s "$url")"
marketID="$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.markets[0].id')"

# :get_market__

# __stream_events:
# Subscribe to the events bus stream for the marketID specified, 
# Required: type field - Switch the event type with '... on [TYPE]' syntax, NOTE: All event is not supported by GraphQL API.
# Required: batchSize field - Default: 0 - Total number of events to batch on server before sending to client.
# Optional: Market identifier - filter by market
#           Party identifier - filter by party
# By default, all events on all markets for all parties will be returned on the stream.
# Event types and schema can be found here: https://docs.testnet.vega.xyz/docs/api-howtos/event-stream/

Once you enter the query and click the play button, graphQL playground will return the data you were looking for. 


2) https://github.com/hasura/graphqurl is a CLI for running graphQL queries. You can use this to run these queries in your terminal. Follow the instructions on the graphqurl readMe to install and use this tool.

# Sample API scripts - Propose Markets

These scripts talk to a Vega node as well as a Vega wallet to propose/create a new market:

- Login to existing wallet
- Select key-pair
- Find an existing asset with a specific name
- Get current time on Vega blockchain
- Prepare and submit a new market proposal
- Wait for market proposal to be accepted and processed
- Vote on the proposal
- Wait for voting to succeed
- Wait for market to become available on Vega

Please see the documentation on Vega for further information.

## Python + requests

Interact with wallet and node API operations using python3 and the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library [REST API]:

```bash
python3 propose-markets/propose-vote-enact-market.py
```
